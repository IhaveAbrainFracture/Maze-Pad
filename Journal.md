Total hours ~17

# 9/07/25 ~5h hours 
the plan is to work on electronics. already had a look at the hackpad guide  and had a long discussion with taran(hackpad nerd) and he suggested i start with a pcb so thats what im doing. also as a note it was rly cool to learn how to finnaly make pcbs

aight time to explain, so the first image is the major sketch which provides extrudes for the case lid,base and side connector. more or less this is the big thing that everythign is based on. the following images are of me importing the pcb,switches and xiaos while assemblying them, as a note in onshape u have a area to make parts and a area to assemble parts so if you import a pcb with a xiao on it guess what you gotta make that xiao then mate it to the pcb its like being given a bag of legos without instructions. ik a few of the photos are of the mazes and that works by either importing an image and then tracing it like on the case or full sending and messing around like on the keycaps. another fun note is that i accidently CADed the entire thing upside down :< oh ye and the 3rd last picture is the original colour plan but as you may figure out it look a little to close to the nazi germany flag so i changed it
